# API Integration Hub üåê

Welcome to my project demonstrating the power of API integration using .NET Core. This repository features three distinct API implementations to enhance user experience with real-time and relevant data.

----

## Project Overview

In this project, I've integrated:

1. **Weather API**: Get real-time weather updates for any city, making it easy to stay informed about current conditions. üå¶Ô∏è
2. **Movie API**: Access detailed information on popular and favorite films. üé•
3. **Meal API**: Discover recipes based on chosen ingredients and find new meal ideas. üç≤

Each API interaction has been designed for seamless user experience and efficient data handling.
